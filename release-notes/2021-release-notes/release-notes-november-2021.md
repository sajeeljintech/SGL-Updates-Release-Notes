# ðŸ“” Release Notes - November 2021

## New Changes

### Apply Payments

There have been significant changes to applying payments in an effort to create a more efficient payment process for the users.

Users can select the checkbox to "Include All Shows" and then select their subset of Entries. From the wheel select "Apply Payments" as they would have in the past.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619be7f8e321a.png)

A dialog box will appear as it typically would, however now there will be NO Entries selected - the default will be that none are selected.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619be862a84e3.png)

Select which Entries you want to apply the payment to by checking the box in the second to last column.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619be8e07ffbb.png)

Once the Entries are selected, the user can select how they want to make the payment from the dropdown under Payment Type

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619be90a65ff2.png)

Next, click on the arrow on the line that reads Amount. This will calculate the total for the Entries selected.

Last, select Apply.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619be987e2bd5.png)

There will be a progress bar that appears on the top of the screen and then after completion the Entries will now read $0.00 under balance and the words Payment Successful will show in green on the bottom left hand corner.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619be9f278555.png)

New in this feature, the dialog box will NOT close - it will remain open and the user can repeat the Payment action to any of the Entries in the list. The dialog box will only close once the user selects Close.

### Payment Batches

There have been significant changes made to Payment Batches in order to accommodate show companies in two different scenarios.

1\) Where the Show Company utilizes an exhibitor's prize money as payments against their entries

Or

2\) Where the Show Company wants to simply pay out all prize money regardless of the balance on the entries.

There is a new option in System Preferences which will change the way that this behaves. The user can either select in the Payment Batch to have Credit Balances Only transferred or All Prize Money and Available Credit.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619beb4cb31f8.png)

> IMPORTANT - Please set this preference for how you wish payment batches to work PRIOR to using the feature

Once you have set the preference, in RTO's the user selects Payment Batches from the Wheel.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bebc17e2c6.png)

A dialog box will appear where the user can pick to which show they want to apply the payment batch to.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bec1e4927d.png)

Depending on which preference you set the system will calculate payable amounts for each entry. A progress bar will show progress while these calculations are made.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bec7b4dd35.png)

Once the progress bar has completed a dialog box appears with Entry details.

Please note that we have added a feature that any unapplied prize money can be applied directly from this interface.  If you wish to apply unapplied prize money check this box.  Any red text indicates that some prize money can't applied, this would typically be because the prize money recipient doesn't have a SSN on file but your show company requires one. Those particular Entries in the list will show in red and the user will be unable to select them in the list

In the far right hand column To Be Paid, the user can see how much to be paid after the Prize Money is applied.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619becd9f4171.png)

The user can select the Entries for which they want to move the credits for by using the checkbox on the left hand column.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bedc55d7c6.png)

Once the user has selected the Entries they wish to include in the batch, they can select the Move Credit to Account option on the bottom.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bedfc59f8d.png)

A message will pop up, asking the user if they are sure:

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bee1984c9f.png)

Once the credits have been processed, the dialog box will shift to the 2nd tab labeled _Create Batch_&#x20;

### **Notes about this screen**

1. This screen shows the RTO accounts which may receive payments.  The system is designed to create a single check to the Prize Money Recipient or Responsible Party (for overpayments) even if there are multiple entries with credits for the customer.
2. Any RTO Account that is highlighted in red is indicating that the account still has an existing balance OWED to the show company after the these credits have been applied.  If you click on any row you can see the details of the particular account.  And what past entries or activities are contributing to their account balance.
3. You may create a payment batch that contains: _Prize Money Only, Balance Refund Only,_ or _Both_&#x20;
   1. Prize Money Only - This will include only credits from Prize money applied to their account
   2. Balance Refund Only - This will generate checks for credits that are due exclusively due to overpayment, any credits from Prize Money will not be included.
   3. Both - This will include all types of credits and a check can be generated that has a mix of Prize Money and Refunds. The details of the check will include lines for each credit and indicate which type it is.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bee67c869a.png)

> IMPORTANT - Rows highlighted in Red MAY be selected for payment.  The highlight is to bring attention to the past balance but the user can still opt to include their payment in the batch.

User can select each RTO account using the checkboxes on the left hand column.  If you do not include all accounts you can repeat this step at a later time to create additional payment batches later.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bef6784866.png)

Once the user has selected the RTOs for Payment Batches they can select _Create Payment Batch_ on the bottom right hand corner.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619befa08c08c.png)

Once this is complete, the user will find themselves on the last tab of the dialog box titled Post Payments. This dialog box gives users the option to either put in manually the starting check number for the payment batch or have it be auto-filled.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619befcb4ca7f.png)

The user can select which RTO's they want from the list and complete any of the following actions: Print Statement, Print Summary, Print Invoice, Export to QB, Export CSV, Post to Account or Delete.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bf0898fbc5.png)

We Recommend that you export for your accounting software using either the CSV or Quickbooks options (QB).  Both these options will help generate checks that contain all details of the payment including the placing and class prize money was earned in.  You may do this export PRIOR to posting to their accounts.  When you select the export it each account that is checked will be included in the entry.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bf0e3759e4.png)

It is important to POST the checks to the RTO accounts once there are checks issued.  The credit will remain pending until its officially posted which should occur after the checks are printed and sent.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bf116c2569.png)

Once this action has been completed, the checks for each account will move to the bottom list and the balance on the account will reflect the check that has been issued to them.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/img\_619bf13fa0eb7.png)

If the user needs to void a check payment after it has been posted, they can select the desired RTO's and select Void Selected Checks.

Once complete, the user can close the window using the button on the bottom left.

## New RTO Reports

Per request, there have been two new RTO reports added to see breakdowns of transactions in either the show or the series.

## Small Changes and Bug Fixes

1. The Show Name was overlapping the Abbreviation field causing it to not work, this has been corrected.
2. There was a bug where if a rider was changed on a horse entered in a division, the entry was duplicated. This has been corrected.
3. There was a bug where if a fee split record was deleted it did not clear the boolean on fee indicating "fee split". This has been corrected.
