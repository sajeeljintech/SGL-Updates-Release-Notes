# ðŸ“” Release Notes - March 2021

## New Changes

### Assigning Entry Numbers to Web Entry Changes

Renumbering in other shows: This will only work if 1) the show is a part of a series and 2) the series has the "Maintain Entry Number" option checked as true. Otherwise, this entry will only be numbered for the selected show.

Order: The order of entries being numbered will now be processed in the same order the user has selected in their list view.

### Bulk Membership Update Tool

Under the Entries wheel menu, users can now update in bulk for USEF, EC, & FEI memberships of Horses and RTOs. Simply select the entries that you wish to update and then select Update Memberships

### Combing & Splitting Divisions

Show companies will be able to combine selected classes and/or divisions. If the user selects one or more division then it will combine and set up the interface for them. There will be a red message on the bottom of the screen confirming that the divisions are going to be combined.

Once combined, it will show in the division module that the class is a part of the combined division. The user can individually change/edit the names of the classes in combined division as well.
