# ðŸ“” Release Notes - February 2021

## New Changes

### Assigning Entry Numbers to Web Entries

We have added the ability to bulk update Entry Numbers using the quick action wheel.Entries must be selected first to utilize this tool.

The user will input the starting entry number.

&#x20;_Note: if the starting Entry Number already exists, the user will receive an error message._&#x20;

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img\_60365e7c920a6.png)

The Entry Numbers are assigned sequentially from the users inputted starting number. If there is a number in between tat is already assigned then the entry will be the next available number. Entries of the same horse in future shows are also updated if the entry number to assign is available in that show.

### Updates to the Quick Search & Verification Tools

We have added a Social Security Number or Federal ID checkbox in the verification tool. We have also added the option to the verification tool to verify a membership for the duration of the show. _Please note that with this option the membership is considered valid only when it is valid for the entire duration of that particular show._&#x20;

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img\_60365c1f8fe9d.png)

The following options have been removed from the "Quick Search" menu, as a result of updates to the verification tool.

_Missing Social Security or Federal ID_&#x20;

_Missing USEF or USHJA Numbers_

_People Missing Valid Membership_

_Horse Missing Valid Membership_

_Horse Missing Valid USHJA Membership_

_People and Horse Missing Valid Membership_

_Missing Safe Sport Training_

_Horses Missing Microchip_&#x20;

### Division Standings Window

We have added the Horse and/or Rider Status column to the Division standings details making it easier to determine any points that should be eliminated for any combined classes

### RTO - Search by Phone Number

A phone number search has been added for RTO. This will search in both "Phone Number" and "Mobile Number" fields. You can also search phone number in the bottom search tool of RTOs.  This behaves as a "contains" search so you can search for any part of the number not only the entire 10 digit number.

### Moving Entries from One Show to Another

We added a feature for moving entries from a show to another.  This is a complex feature and we STRONGLY advise using it with caution.  This feature moves all aspects of the entry from one show to another, when completed the entry will no longer be in the original show at all.  This feature only works to move entries where all aspects of the show setup are identical including Fees, Classes

Highlight the **destination show** from the shows list to which user wants to move entries. To move entries, select quick action 'Move Entries to Show'.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img\_602fe6866bd51.png)

From show selection dialog, select the source show from which user wants to import entries.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img\_602688a02b06b.png)

In next step, if there are some missing classes, divisions and show fees in destination show then we display the errors in move entries verification step and user cannot proceed with the move entries to show process without fixing those errors.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img\_602688c3b55b6.png)

If there are no errors, then the user can click on 'Move Entries' button. _\*\*Please note that moving entries involves records from two different shows. If any records related to an entry is locked by another user that entry, and its related records, are ignored and the user will have to run the process again later._

After entry move, entry is marked as moved from show by adding message in change history.

### Changes to "My Horse" Subscription

Previously, only exhibitors linked to an entry could purchase a "My Horse" subscription. We have changed this, so that anyone can purchased the "My Horse" subscription as long as they know the horse's entry number.
