# ðŸ“” Release Notes - December 2021

## New Changes

### Membership Overrides

In an effort to make the override tool as efficient as possible, we now have added the option to override a Horse or Rider's status with new fields where the user can override Horse Type, Horse Age, Rider Status, or Rider Age.

The Rider Status is computed from 4 fields of information automatically, however if there is an existing override for the governing organization then the status will use the values that the user enters into the override.

#### **For a Horse**

To override a Horse's status, from the Entry select the field of which you wish to override and double click. (EC, USEF, FEI etc)

The override dialog box will appear and then you can update the Horse's status. \*\*\*NOTE: You **MUST** add a reason or the record will not save.

Once you have saved the override, if you open the Classes tab in the Entry, the override will be noted by the status showing in yellow. This indicates that either the horse, rider, or both were modified using the Temporary Override tool.

### Updates to Online Schedule

We have updated our online schedule to show grouped classes together. We hope that this will eliminate certain confusion for exhibitors participating in grouped classes. This update is for both the desktop version and IOS app.
