### Feed Delivery System

The feed delivery system is designed to allow exhibitors to orders supplies online and facility the delivery of those supplies to the customer. When the process is completed the customer will receive delivery confirmation via SMS.

### Setup in ShowGrounds

To setup this system there are a few things that must be done.

> IMPORTANT: Your show company must be a subscriber to the ShowGrounds texting service so notifications can be sent to the customer. If you are not sure if you have this service please contact support@showgroundsonline.com

#### **Step 1: Associate each item you will deliver with a Master fee.**

Ensure each item you will be delivering is associated with a ‚ÄúMaster Fee‚Äù record. You can do this by editing the fee record and verifying that a master fee record is selected.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/img\_61118b6d19de6.png)

#### **Step 2: Open the Master fee records and check off the ‚ÄúPhysical Delivery‚Äù check box.**

This enables the item to be used in the delivery system on the web.

### Adding Fees in ShowGrounds

Once your items are setup you can add fees in the ShowGrounds client for an entry as you would any fee. For items that require physical delivery you will be prompted for a barn and stall location to deliver to as well as the customers phone number to text when the order is delivered.

### Viewing a Fee in ShowGrounds

You may double click a fee record that has delivery defined for it and see the status of the delivery. Simply double click the fee record to view.

You‚Äôll notice the ‚ÄúOrder Delivery‚Äù section at the bottom which will have current status, delivery location, etc.

### Processing Orders on the Web

Any person that is going to be responsible for delivering supplies to customers must first have a showgroundslive.com login. If they have not done so already ask them to register for a login. Once they have you can add them to the group that provides access to the feed delivery system. If you are unfamiliar with this process please contact support@showgroundsonline.com

Once a user is registered and added to the correct group they may login at your showgroundslive.com site. For instance showgroundslive.com/xyz (where xyz is your show company)

For the use to access orders they can login and they should be able to click on the ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù link at the top of the left hand navigations

Once at this address they user may wish to bookmark the site and or save a shortcut to their home screen.

### Processing Orders

Once the user is in the delivery tool they will see all pending items. They can view items by Category or by Entry. This allows them to either delivery a type of product or delivery all products for a single order.
