## Bugs & Small Fixes

1. There was a bug where a rider being removed from classes still showing in those classes, this has been corrected.
2. There was a bug found using the SGL Timer Node for FarmTech while also using HTML scoreboard feature for the same ring when configured in the facility record. The solution is to run the scoreboard only from RVS Ring Configuration. The option will be removed from the facility.
3. The new order of go PDF with the rider flags did not include show name, date, or horse breed. This has been corrected.
4. There was a bug when trying to combine more than 3 divisions, this has been corrected.
