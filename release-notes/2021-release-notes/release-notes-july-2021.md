# ðŸ“” Release Notes - July 2021

## Equine Canada Updates

### **EC Lookups**

All customer systems are now utilizing generic access to Equine Canada, unless customer specific credentials are entered. This allows EC look-ups to work for US based companies.

### **EC Information for RTO's & Horses**

In order to provide more comprehensive EC information for both Horse and RTO's we have updated the information shown associated with an EC number.

### **Results**

We have also updated the results report for EC based on the new criteria that they have provided.

### **Search by Name**

Also now available with this integration update, the exhibitors can now search for their horses on ShowGrounds by name. Previously, it was only by passport number.

### EC Sanctions & Class Types

We have changed the logic for the EC Section Codes. The class type and sanction type will no longer be dependent on the Class Sanction Code. You can select the type of class and sanction level from the dropdown in the class detail page.

### Country Codes & Account Registration for SGL

We have updated our registration process  to include other Country Codes for phone number verification. Previously, a user was only able to register with a verified number, and only numbers with (+1) country codes were verified.
