### Updates to Stabling Reservations - Check in/out times

We have updated the stabling reservation tab during the entry process to allow show companies to require a check in and out time.

To utilize and set up this feature, you can find this under the Settings option under SGL Functions.

We is now a tab named "Stabling Setting" within settings to allow users to select if they wish to utilize the stabling with check in and check out times.

To use this feature, check the checkbox for "Collect stabling check-in/check-out time" and input the desired information for check-in and check-out dates and times.

After the settings have been selected if an exhibitor creating an entry adds a Stabling product in the add entry process or supply ordering process, then they is asked to provide the check-in and check-out dates and times once, regardless of how many stalls are ordered. These check-in and check-out selections will also be applied to all Entries throughout the series if they are added to more than one show in the Add Series option.

Please note that this feature is ONLY available in the plug-in site.

### Horse Holds

We have modified the "Vet Hold" option to now be located under the Horses module and not the Entries module. Horses on hold will not be able to be added to entries online but they can be added from office. They also cannot have classes added to them until the hold is removed.
