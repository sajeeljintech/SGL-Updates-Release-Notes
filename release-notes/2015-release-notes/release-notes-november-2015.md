## Changes to Reports

We're taking a close look at reports to determine which show companies use specific reports, and we're streamlining the way these reports are accessed. Less clutter and more of what you need in your report listing!

1. The _**Feed Order Delivery Report**_ has been updated to save paper and relabeled to prevent theft of barn deliveries.
2. Need stats _STAT_? New Report: _**RTO - Count Report**_.  This report gives stats on riders, owners, trainers and provinces/states.
3. We have added a memo/invoice # column‚Ä® to the _**Fee Detail Report**_ by entry number.
4. We've enabled the option to print a list of non-zero balances (credits as well as balances due) on one report.

## Small Changes That Make a Big Impact

Read on for some important changes that will impact your day-to-day operations at the show office:

1. When entering a horse (or person) in an Entry and the list comes up, we have made it possible to double-click (on something on that list) to select it. You've already got your hand on the mouse and it saves time!
2. Have you seen the new column called "secured" on the Entries list? This  means that there is a credit card on file. Good to know!
3. In the Entry-Trainer Splits, we have changed the sort in the drop-down options by last names. Much more useful.
4. We have enabled the ability to manually edit what has been verified in Champion Reserve, just in case.
5. Clearing up confusion on customer's invoices: trainer splits are now shown under  ‚ÄúOther fees‚Äù and not under Payment/Credits.
6. When a balance roll forward happens the description is often too long to see onscreen or on a report. We've abbreviated wherever possible.
7. We have added the option of a GST# to invoices in addition to USEF.

### More Automatic Logging -- Better Details for You

We added logging to the History tab of Entries. Included is: logging of Payments (no matter where it came from) and Payment Reversals. We log when trainer splits are applied to an account. If an entry is added during class verification, then it‚Äôs logged. During class verification, if certain entries are marked as ‚Äúscratched‚Äù (did not compete), then it's logged. Fore example: ‚ÄúEntry 100, marked as did not compete in class 200, during class verification.‚Äù
