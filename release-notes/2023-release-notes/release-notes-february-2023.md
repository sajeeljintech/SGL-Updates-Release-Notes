# ðŸ“” Release Notes - February 2023

## New Changes

### FEI Results export - Team classes

We have added support to export FEI results for Jumper Table "Team Scoring". FEI requires team's Country information for results submission. If Team type is Organization, users can now provide country information for team.

If a teams country information is missing, during FEI results export we will set "USA" as the default country.

## Small Changes & Bug Fixes

1. There was an issue when copying shows where the Fees checkbox was unselectable. This has been fixed.
