# ðŸ“” Release Notes - August 2023

## New Changes

### Validating Memberships

We have changed the way memberships are validated in an entry.&#x20;

When in the entry, if you type the membership number into the search bar and search, it will automatically bring up the person's information and validate the membership number.\

Previously, for the membership number to show as validated, you would have to save the entry, exit, and then go back into the entry for it to show.&#x20;

## Small Changes and Bug Fixes

1. There was a bug with verifying EC memberships. Verifying them would save for the day, and then the next day, they would all be incorrect again. This has been fixed.&#x20;
