# ðŸ“” Release Notes- November 2023







## USEF Officials and Results Updates

We have made changes to how USEF officials and results are reported.



### Show Detail Page Changes

In the show detail page, the box that used to be titled "Judges" is now titled "Officials."&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (159).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

People listed as officials in the show will be listed by their name, their USEF # and whether they are acting as a judge or a course designer.&#x20;

#### Adding and Removing Officials

Adding an official is done by choosing the plus button on the right side of the Officials box. This will bring up a box to search the RTOs.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have found the person you want to add as an official, you can choose whether that person is a judge or a course designer.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have selected the type of official, clicking ok will add that person as an official and their information will show in the list of officials.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (52).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If an official is not assigned to a class and needs to be removed from the list, this can be done by highlighting the specific person and hitting the minus sign. This will remove that person from the list of officials.&#x20;

#### Changing Official Type

If you have added an official and need to change that person's official type, this can be done by double-clicking that specific person.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will bring up a box to update the type.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have chosen the new type and click ok, the system will ask if you are sure you want to make this change.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Clicking Ok will update that person's official type in any classes or class groups this person is assigned to. &#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (56).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Class Detail Page Changes

In each class under the Judges & Schedule tab, there is a dropbox titled "Select an official to add..."

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each of the officials that have been added to that show, will be in that dropbox. To add an official to a particular class, you will just choose the desired person from that dropbox.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have picked the official, it will show in the list. The official's name, USEF number, and official type will show in the list in the class.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Removing an official from a class is done so by highlighting the specific official and hitting the minus sign. This will remove the official from that class list.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you do not highlight an individual and hit the minus sign, an error message will appear.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### "Assign Officials to Classes" Bulk Tool

We have added the tool to bulk add officials to multiple classes. This is done by highlighting, or creating a subset of classes.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (62).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user will then go to the Quick Wheel menu. The option to add officials to classes is at the very bottom of the menu.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (63).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you choose this option, a box will popup to select the desired official for those classes. Each of your officials assigned to the show will appear in the dropbox.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have selected your desired official, you will choose the add button.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have selected add, the system will inform you the number of classes your official has been assigned to.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



### "Removing Officials From Classes" Bulk Tool

Along with the bulk add tool, we have added a bulk removal tool.&#x20;



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (49).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This removal tool works exactly like the bulk add tool. The user will choose a subset of classes and then choose the Remove Officials from Classes option. Clicking that tool will bring up the box for the official removal.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From this dropbox, you will choose the specific official you want to remove from the classes.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have selected your official, you will hit the remove button.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The system will then inform you that your official has been removed from those classes. To exit this removal, you will hit the done button.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Simple Scheduler Changes

The ability to assign officials in the simple scheduler itself has been added as well. There is now an Assign Official button towards the top of the page.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (67).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Officials can be assigned by highlighting the desired class. If you have multiple classes you want to assign, you can highlight the multiple classes and then choose the Assign Official button.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (68).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The box to select your specific official will come up and you will choose your official and select add.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (69).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The system will then inform you that the official has been added to those classes.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (70).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If an official is assigned to a class group and a class is added into that group, the official is then assigned to that class as well.&#x20;

If a class is removed from the class group with an assigned official, the official will not be removed from that class.&#x20;

### USEF Results Export

The USEF results export has been updated to include the 2024 USEF Results Template Changes.

These changes include Horse/Rider Falls, Judge's USEF Numbers, and Course Designer's USEF Numbers.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (71).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

\*Please note that after this implementation, judges already assigned to shows and classes will not be visible.&#x20;



## USEF Horse/Rider Elimination Codes

With the new requirements from USEF, we have added the new elimination codes to the system.&#x20;

### Elimination Codes

USEF has updated the list of elimination codes that should be used when reporting results.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With these new codes, we had to add them into the system to make reporting results work correctly.&#x20;



#### Announcer Interface

In the announcer interface, the elimination reason dropdown now shows a descriptive list to choose from instead of just the elimination codes. This gives the user a more detailed list of elimination reasons to choose from instead of quickly trying to determine the correct code.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (161).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The elimination reason will show as the correct elimination code in the results export.



### Results Export

There are minor changes in the USEF Results export to accomodate these new changes in report results.&#x20;

With the extended codes from 2 characters to 6, the placings column has been extended to comply with the 6 character codes.&#x20;



#### Small Changes and Bug Fixes

1. There was an issue when running USEF lookups, it would create a USHJA number using the USEF number, so it would be incorrect. This has been fixed, so now running a USEF lookup will correctly populate the USHJA information.&#x20;
2. There was an issue with different tools/options going missing or not allowing users to access them when normally they were able to. This issue was due to permissions getting reset incorrectly. This has been fixed.&#x20;
3. There was a small bug with non-system reports in which only the user who created the report could make any changes. This has been changed so all users in the Administrators group can edit/save non-system reports.
4. The Owner field in the Horse Membership Detail API was showing the raw data that was received from the lookups. We have added separate fields in the membership detail to display the values received in the Owners field separately.&#x20;
