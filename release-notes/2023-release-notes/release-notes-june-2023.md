# ðŸ“” Release Notes - June 2023

## New Changes

### Fee Splits to Include All Entries

When splitting fees in Trainer Accounts, we have added a checkbox to select all when splitting fees so that the user does not have to individually check all of the boxes one at a time, they can simply check all Entires.

### Update to System Preferences

There is not a System Preference option in Report Preferences tab to Suppress Payment Reversals. This means that if you apply a payment and then reverse the same payment, if this box is checked then it will not show this transaction on the exhibitor's invoice.

## Small Changes & Bug Fixes

1. There was a bug when using the feature for carrying entry numbers through a series that did not take trainer accounts into the logic. This has been fixed.
2. There was an issue when combining classes that would cause the class type to clear out. This has been fixed.
3. We have added an option to allow dropping of completed trips from the verification tool in the All Entries section.
4. There was a bug where classes that had already been scheduled and then were later combined were not being properly grouped together on the schedule, this has been corrected.
