# üìì Release Notes - November 2013

We've got great new features to announce from ShowGrounds! Read on for details and please contact us if you'd like more info or help.

## New Features

### Web-based Order of Go tool

The web-based order of go tool allows your staff to set orders no matter where they are through a convenient web interface.

To learn more about using this tool [go here](http://showgroundsonline.com/new/how-to-setting-orders-of-go-via-web-browser/).

### Credit card storage available to users

Now riders, trainers, and owners can input their credit card info and have it stored on ShowGroundsLive.com for later use by them or the show office. As you know, this is super secure and a great time-saver.

Users can also add a personalized description as a reminder for future payments. See example below earmarked for the Smiths:

### Small changes to payment batches

We‚Äôve made a number of small improvements in the Payment Batches system.

1. Enhanced Quickbooks export - Now allows you to select if checks should be marked as ‚ÄúTo Print‚Äù.  Can export both posted and non-posted payments.\
   Also able to provide over-ride description for check memos.
2. It is now possible to edit check numbers both before and after checks are posted.
3. We also added a column for check numbers with title references when viewing payments in RTO account screen.

### RTO balance summary report

This report can now be exported to Excel with ease.

When a membership record is over-ridden from the entry itself it now  results in a history record being created for that entry. The text will correspond to the RTO.
