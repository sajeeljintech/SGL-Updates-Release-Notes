# ðŸ“” Release Notes - November 2014

Check it out! This release note covers details through Version 4.02.19.

## _**New on SGLive.com**_: Got Prize Lists?

Show companies can now upload documents to appear on their landing page. Prize lists, entry blanks -- and more! These can be in PDF, Excel, Word, etc. Here's an example from South Florida Hunter Jumper Association, where the 2014 Charity Prize List is located under Documents:

To take advantage of this cool new feature, go to a new admin function on ShowGroundsLive.com called "Manage Documents."

This allows anyone designated as a Show Company Admin to add/edit/and delete documents.

The document can appear on a specific show page -- or it can appear on the landing page of _all shows_. We are working to tailor this feature to a specific series as well.

### Foreign Citizens in Entries

Available only in the back-office software, ShowGrounds has added the option to mark foreign residents during the entry process. If doing an entry in the office, just check "Foreign Resident" below:

### Setting Orders of Go

We've received reports from in-gate users that they really like the side-by-side layout of our new Order of Go tool!

More good news: The side-by-side lists of trips remaining and ordered trips will increase (it shows 20-30 before needing to scroll). Also, we're making sure that the list continues to scroll as a new trip is added. Enjoy -- and keep the feedback coming!

Next up on our list is correcting an issue with dragging and dropping when using Safari and confirming that single trips interweave properly.

### Exporting to BCHJA

For show companies exporting to British Columbia Hunter Jumper Association, we have added the division codes to the export.  Now when an export is executed, the following fields are included: Show / Horse / Competitor Number / Owner / Rider **/** Division code / Class Number / Class Name / Placing / Entries In Class / Pony Size / Birthdate / Trainer
