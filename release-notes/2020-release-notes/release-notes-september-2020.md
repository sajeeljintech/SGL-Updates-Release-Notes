# ðŸ““ Release Notes - September 2020

## New Changes

### Requiring a Stall for Entry of a Show

Show companies can now require that entries have a stall to be able to enter a show. There is now a a checkbox in the General tab of the Show for _Require Entry Stall._&#x20;

should it get replaced by this one?

On the _Show Fee_ record, make sure that _Stabling Fee_ and _Available for Web Ordering_ options are selected for the stall fee.

When the stall fee (or any fee that has _Stabling Fee_ checkbox enabled) is added in the entry the option to select _Trainer Stall Inventory\*_ appears. This will need to be checked within the trainer account so that the quantity of the fee will be considered as available stall inventory to use in the web entries. \*\*Note: This will only be available IF the entry is linked to a trainer account.\*\*

### **Exhibitor View on the Web**

Once the entries are added online, the stall quantity will be checked for within the trainer account of the selected trainer and matched with the trainer's entries. If the inventory is not available, then the user will receive a stop in the _Review Fees_ step.

### **In the Show Office**

Entries can either have stalls added from their trainer account or they can add a stabling fee. This means that the entry will either A) Utilize a stall from the trainer's available inventory or B) add the stall to the entry for them to meet the requirement of having a stall. \*\*NOTE: In the _Show Fee_ record, be sure to set an inventory cap for stalls to ensure that the stalls are not over sold.

If an entry is being added in the show office, users will see a notification on the bottom of the screen notating whether the stall they are assigning to the entry is going to be coming from a trainer's inventory or not. They will also see the remaining inventory for that trainer account.

If the entry is not associated with a trainer and/or no stall has been added, users will not be able to continue with the entry process.

There will also be an error message if the inventory is not available.

### Invoices

In the past users would get an invoice showing differently than the ones that show companies could print off via the Client server. They now will match in hopes for less confusion when users are settling up at the end of a show.
