# ðŸ““ Release Notes - August 2020

## New Changes

### Emailing Multiple Shows at one Time

In the communications section, show companies now have the option to select multiple shows to email at one time. _Note: Ring, Date, and Class Group options are disabled when more than one Show is selected since these filters are dependent on the shows._

### Requiring a Code for Show Entry

Show companies can now require that to enter a show, exhibitors have a specific code. In web settings, check the box to require the code, and then enter it in the blank box.

Exhibitors will have to enter the code while signing up, or they won't be able to continue the process.

### Receipts for Video Subscriptions

Previously, users were not able to go back to their account and directly-download a receipt from the video subscription page. There is not a direct-download button for their video subscriptions under their account where it shows all of their purchased subscriptions.
