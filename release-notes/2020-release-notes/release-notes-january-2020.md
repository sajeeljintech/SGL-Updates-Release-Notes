# ðŸ““ Release Notes - January 2020

## New Changes

### USEF - Rule Change

Changes in USEF rules were made requiring shows to report on entries that "Competed" in their class as well as those that "Completed" their round in their class.  You can read more about these changes here.

### Simple Scheduler - Major enhancements to "Break" handling

We have made a number of improvements to the simple scheduler to make it easier to schedule breaks in classes (drag & waters, etc).  We now allow you to have a "Library" of breaks that are always available to you.  These breaks can be added to a schedule manually (and repeatedly) or distributed through a class (or class group) every X entries.

## Bug Fixes

* Derby Scoring - There was a bug with how derby scores were being stored.  Score 1 was being replicated to score 2 and score 3 was being replicated to score 4. - FIXED
* Record Locking - We are aware that records may become locked when they should not.  We've put in place logging to help our development team understand the circumstances so we may address these issues more completed.
* Duplicate entry numbers when replicating entries from one show to another - Fixed.
*   Allow no jumper table to be selected - We have now made it so you may select "None" for a jumper table when necessary.\
