# ðŸ““ Release Notes - November 2020

## New Changes

### Entry Verification Report

A report called "Entry Verification Report" has been added so show companies can remind people as they check in what the office needs to complete their entries. _NOTE: It requires the verification process to be run first before running the report otherwise will show an alert message._

### Added Requirements for Credit Card Processing

In order to give show companies more control of data requirements for credit card processing, there are now 2 checkboxes in the admin section: "Require Address Information" and "Require Email Address/Phone Information".

### Updates to Simple Scheduler

Within simple scheduler you can now visibly see the last class that has been entered, rather than the class not moving down the page. You also will have the ability to adjust the total width of the schedule grid, not just the columns within. In the Add/Edit section on the smaller grid, you will now be able to view more than 3 classes. You also now have the option to use military time if desired rather than having to adjust for AM or PM.

### Change in Digital Signature Logic

Show companies expressed wanting trainers to be able to sign as agents for their riders, so this is now the default. Previously, the show company would have to ensure that the box was checked. We have changed this to allow them to sign as a default. If you wish to change this function simply click the checkbox on to "Disallow Agent Signature".
