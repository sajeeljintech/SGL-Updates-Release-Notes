# ðŸ““ Release Notes - March 2020

## New Changes

### Non organization "memberships" can now easily be added en masse.

This fix is particularly useful for setting the dates for a number of vaccinations on a group of horses who were done on the same date. In the past, if there was nothing in the membership number box, it would not fill in the information at all, leaving some horses blank.

Select the "Set membership dates" option.

In this case, we select the horse and EHV. Select the start and end date. Check the "Create Membership if missing" option. Select execute.

Any horses that did not previously have anything in the membership box will be autofilled as seen below.
