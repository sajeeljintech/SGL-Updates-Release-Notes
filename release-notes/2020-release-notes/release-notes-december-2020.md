## Changes with Digital Signatures

### **Allowing the Trainer to Sign**

We have added the option to send signature request only to the Trainer. If the checkbox is selected then then the Rider or Owner will not receive any texts requesting signatures or reminders to sign.

### **Text Logic**

In an attempt to avoid sending too many messages to exhibitors for digital signature requests, we have updated the logic. After receiving the first SMS, if the recipient doesn't sign it, and adds more entries, they will not receive additional text for next 4 hours. A reminder text been added. Reminders are sent once per day for each User ID if they have a pending signature request in a future show.

### Ryegate Integration

ShowGrounds is not able to integrate with Ryegate Show Services for live timing & scoring data.

## iOS App Updates

### **Adding Entries**

We have changed the Add Entry process in iOS to allow switching to a different company's show. All current and upcoming shows are listed in the first step of Add Entry screen.

## Small Changes & Bug Fixes

1. There was a bug with exporting FEI to excel, this has been corrected.
2. There was an error with the support link in the iOS app, this has been corrected.
3. There was a small change in the way names were displayed in the digital signature process. It will now be the name on the entry, not the name on the login to avoid duplicate names with different phone numbers.
4. We have added a new report in _Entries_ area _Prize Money With Notes_.
5. The _Stall & Tack Split Report_ has been modified to sort by Entry Number.
