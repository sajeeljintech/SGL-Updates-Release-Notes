## Bug Fixes

1. There was a bug with invoices where the amount of items was getting rounded up - for example if the charge was for 1.5 stalls, this was rounding up to 2 stalls. This has been corrected.
2. There was a bug with the feed report asking the user if the report was printed correctly before it had actually printed. This has been corrected.
3. There was a bug in the communication settings which truncated the header on emails when displayed on a mobile device, this has been corrected.
4. There were exhibitors who were receiving texts at all hours, there will now be no automated text messages sent between the hours of 10 pm and 6 am.
5. There was a bug with the emails being sent without the "from" address being validated, this has been corrected.
