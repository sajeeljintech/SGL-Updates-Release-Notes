#### Small Changes/Bug Fixes

1. It was noted that printed reports were displaying the incorrect ring names while the system and web based views showed correctly. This has been fixed.
2. We have updated the Judge's Cards reports to show disqualification reasons and their abbreviations as a resource for judges.&#x20;
3. We have updated the Stabling Summary by Trainer report to show more stall options. That report now will show up to 10 stall types.&#x20;
4. A bug was discovered where information classes were causing a disruption to live schedules. This has been fixed and the classes are functioning as expected.
5. There was an issue with the Announcer tool not showing all the trips in a Classic class until results were entered. This was due to a code issue for handling trips in these classes. This has been fixed.&#x20;
6. Equine Canada users experienced an issue where Authorized Foreign Competitors were showing as invalid memberships. This has been fixed and these competitors are now verifying correctly.
